            <h2>Bacteriophages Quick Facts:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Bacteriophage is also called "phage"</li>
                <p>
                    Bacterio (coming from the word Bacteria) and phage (from the Greek word "phagein" 
                    meaing "to devour") all together means bacteria eater. Which was coined by Félix d'Hérelle,
                    a French microbiologist.
                </p>
                <li>Can be both simple or complex</li>
                <p>
                    The most common example of a bacteriophage is the T4 phage. Which is shown in many images as
                    the <a href="bacphages.html">general structure of a bacteriophage</a>. However, there are other variations. 
                    The amount of enes a single phage has can vary from less than 4 to hundreds. 
                </p>
                <li>More diverse than all the bacterial species in the world</li>
                <p>
                    The amount of <a href="environment.html">bacteriophage variations</a> outnumber the amount of bacteria in the world. The number of total 
                    bacteriophages, however, is estimated to be 10<sup>31</sup>, outnumbering every other type of organism in the world. Combined.
                </p>
                <li>Approximately 70% of marine bacteria are infected by bacteriophages</li>
                <p>
                    Because of the bacteriophage's overwhelming numbers, they almost dominate the regions where bacteria thrive. That includes warm temperate
                    climates, such as in the ocean. They are such evolutionarily adapted to killing bacteria, that they are now being 
                    utilized for <a href="medicine.html">medical use</a>.
