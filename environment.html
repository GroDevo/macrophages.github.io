            <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <p>
                Bacteriophages are very much prominant in the microscoping world.
                Where there are bacteria, there are bacteriophages.

                        The word "Bacteriophages" in some way means Bacteria consumer.
                        Though, the bacteriophage does not really consume or eat the 
                        bacteria, but more accurately destroys it from the inside. 
                        The <a href="bacphages.html">cycles</a> of the Bacteriophage
                        shows how it effectively eliminates bacterium, sometimes even 
                        altering a bacteria's fundamental DNA.

                        The ocean contains most organisms, or marine organisms, than
                        land organisms. As such, bacteriophages thrive much more in
                        temperate waters than in dry land. Some research suggests that
                        there are as much as 250 million bacteriophages per millilitre of
                        seawater.

                        Bacteriophages were discovered by William Twort in 1915. However,
                        some attribute the credit for the discovery to Felix d' Herelle,
                        who also discovered it independently ay 1917. Bacteriophages were
                        essentially ignored because of antibiotics, though ironically the 
                        role of antibiotics has caused a <a href="medicine">resurgence in research</a> 
                        into bacteriophages for the past few years. Mostly due to the impact
                        Bacteriophages have on bacterial populations.
