            <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <p>
                Bacteriophages are certain types of viruses whose main victims
                are various types of bacteria.

                    <dd>
                        All viruses are characterized by their order, family, and subfamily. 
                        One of the most common types of bacteriophages, T4 species, belongs
                        to the Caudovirales order, of the Myoviridae family, and of the
                        Tevenvirinae subfamily. Each category (order, family, subfamily) 
                        specifies distinctive viruses with distinctive capabilities.

                        Bacteriophages have a very recognizable form since it looks
                        different from what people have traditionally known as a virus 
                        (i.e. a round thing with spikes). Though, viruses are essentially
                        simple. The bacteriophage contains its genetic information inside
                        its protein capsid, which is the fairly round shape above its tail
                        fibre (or what seems like legs). The genetic information is either
                        DNA or RNA.

                    <dd>
                        Just like other viruses, bacteriophages require a host to reproduce.
                        Some phages are capable of 1 or 2 cycles. The Lytic cycle and/or the Lysogenic cycle.
