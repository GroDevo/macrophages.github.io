            <h2>Medical Use of Bacteriophages</h2>
            <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <p>
                The use and research of bacteriophages for medical purposes has increased as a result
                of the rise of superbug, or drug-resistant, bacteria.

                        The use of bacteriophages was surprisingly abundant in the 1920s-1930s
                        since it was a reliable treatment for bacterial infections. Early use of
                        bacteriophages can be traced in the Republic of Georgia, during the time
                        of the Soviet Union. Where it was widely used by the soldiers in the 
                        Red Army.

                        In the western world, antibiotics began to be rapidly developed right after
                        bacteriophages were sufficiently used to treat infections. It was not adopted
                        since antibiotics were much more reliable and easier to distribute. Though, as a 
                        result of that, bacteria began to evolve to become immune to different types of drugs.
                        Some can even survive in alcohol. Among one of the feared drug-resistant bacteria
                        is called MDR TB, Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis.

                        Approximately 35,000 deaths occur in the United States as a result of drug-resistant
                        bacteria, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p1113-antibiotic-resistant.html#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention%20%28CDC%29,35%2C000%20deaths%20in%20the%20United%20States%20each%20year.">CDC</a>.
                        As a result, clinical trials and research involving bacteriophages and their effectivity
                        have begun to increase for the past few years. And it has shown promising results. More pharmaceutical companies
                        have yet to invest along with the FDA.
